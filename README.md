# Sustainable-Fertilizer-Usage-Optimizer-for-Higher-Yield
## SIH 2024
Excessive and improper fertilizer use contributes to soil degradation and diminished agricultural productivity, adversely affecting farmers' income. This project aims to develop a data-driven application that provides tailored fertilizer recommendations by analyzing soil health, crop types, and weather patterns. 
The dataset (`crop.csv`) includes critical variables such as crop types, fertilizer types and quantities, soil conditions, and weather data, enabling comprehensive analysis.
By ensuring sustainable agricultural practices, the solution seeks to enhance crop yields while promoting environmental stewardship, ultimately improving farmers' financial stability.
